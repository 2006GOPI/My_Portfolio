# Images Folder

This folder is for your portfolio images and assets.

## Required Images

### Favicons
Place the following favicon files in this folder:
- `favicon-16x16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `favicon-32x32.png` - 32x32 pixels
- `apple-touch-icon.png` - 180x180 pixels

You can generate favicons from your logo using tools like:

- https://favicon.io/

### Open Graph Image
- `og-image.jpg` - 1200x630 pixels (for social media sharing)

### Profile Photo
The current website uses Unsplash placeholder images. Replace with your own:
- Professional headshot for the About section
- Recommended size: 500x500 pixels minimum
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Keep file size under 200KB for optimal performance

### Project Images
Add screenshots/images of your projects in this folder:
- Recommended size: 800x600 pixels or larger
- Format: JPG or WebP for best performance
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `project-ecommerce.jpg`)

## Image Optimization Tips

1. **Compress images** before uploading:
   - Use tools like TinyPNG, ImageOptim, or Squoosh
   - Target file size: Under 200KB per image

2. **Use modern formats**:
   - WebP format provides better compression
   - Provide fallbacks for older browsers if needed

3. **Responsive images**:
   - Provide different sizes for different screen resolutions
   - Use appropriate image dimensions

4. **Alt text**:
   - Always update alt text in HTML for accessibility
   - Describe what's in the image

## Current Placeholder Images

The website currently uses Unsplash images as placeholders:
- About section profile photo
- Portfolio project thumbnails

Replace these in the HTML file (`index.html`) by updating the `src` attributes of `<img>` tags.
